# Detection Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Good understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and filtering logs.
- Ability to write simple rules using known attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of configuration and background process.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Operating Systems: Widows Server 2019, Ubuntu, Kali Linux.
- SIEM system (ELK Stack) for log ingestion and analysis.
- HYDRA to perform bruteforce attack.
